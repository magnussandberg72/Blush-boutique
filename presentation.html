    <h2>Help with food money for Fatimah 🙏🏼</h2>
    <p>Fatimah is a kind, loving woman, trying to do her best. She has worked in a supermarket, and most recently at a stone/gravel quarry, with a monthly salary of about 70 USD.</p>
    <p>She covers the monthly bills and medicine for her sick mother, but the food money just isn’t enough to cover basic food costs.</p>
    <p>My name is Magnus, I am from Sweden, and I got to know Fatimah in 2024. She is my friend, and I have helped her with food money now and then. As I have understood, salaries in Ghana are very low.</p>
    <p>All support goes via her mother <b>Mavis Boakye</b> (Fatimah’s mom), directly to Fatimah through MTN Mobile Money and WorldRemit.</p>
    <p>Please send some food money to Fatimah through the WorldRemit app. Every gift is a blessing for her and her mom – they are very poor. Thank you for your kindness 🙏🏼</p>
