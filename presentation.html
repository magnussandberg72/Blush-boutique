      <h2>Help with food money for Fatimah 🙏🏼</h2>
      <p>Fatimah is a kind, loving woman, trying to do her best.</p>
      <p>
        She has worked in a supermarket, and most recently at a stone/gravel quarry,
        with a monthly salary of about 70 USD.
      </p>
      <p>
        She covers the monthly bills and medicine for her sick mother, but the work money just isn’t enough
        to cover both monthly bills, And basic food costs. please send $10, to oatmeal and milk 🙏🏼.
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Magnus, I am from Sweden, and I got to know Fatimah in 2024. She is my friend,
        and I have helped her with food money now and then. As I have understood, salaries in Ghana are very low.
      </p>
      <p>
        All support goes via her mother <strong>Mavis Boakye</strong> (Fatimah’s mom),
        directly to Fatimah through MTN Mobile Money and WorldRemit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please send some food money to Fatimah through the WorldRemit app.
        Every gift is a blessing for her and her mom – they are very poor.
        Thank you for your kindness 🙏🏼
